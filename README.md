# Network Utility

This Python script is a command-line utility for performing various networking actions such as displaying network interface information, checking connectivity, restarting networking services, and configuring network interfaces.

I wrote this code as part of a practical activity during my studies at university. It served as an exercise to apply networking concepts learned in class to real-world scenarios.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system.

### Running the Script

1. Clone this repository or download the `network_utility.py` file.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `network_utility.py`.
4. Run the script with the desired action and optional arguments.

```bash
python3 network_utility.py <action> [--host HOST] [--address ADDRESS] [--netmask NETMASK] [--interface INTERFACE]
